# Setup

Run `yarn`

# Build 

Run `yarn build`

# Test

Start the app `dist-electron/test.app` and refresh the page (cmd + R) if necessary.

The video at the top does not load in electron 7/8/9, while the bottom one does.

In electron 6, both videos can be viewed. 

The stream protocol procedure allows for modifying the stream on the fly, while the file protocol does not.

# Notes

Not tested with `electron .` and does not matter as the application cannot be shipped that way to customers.
